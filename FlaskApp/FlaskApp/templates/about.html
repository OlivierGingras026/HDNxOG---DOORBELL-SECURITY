                    This project is a comprehensive smart home security system centered around a Raspberry Pi. It integrates various sensors for environmental and security monitoring, utilizing an Ultrasonic sensor to detect doorstep presence, triggering a full alert system with a buzzer, LED, and camera snapshot functionality. All data and control commands are managed through this web dashboard, which communicates with the Raspberry Pi hardware via Adafruit IO.

                <h4 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-3">Milestone 2: Integrated System Deployment</h4>
                <p>
                    In this milestone, we successfully achieved our main goal of <strong>integrating at least three devices and three sensors</strong>, and placing the entire system into a more organized enclosure. The addition of the <strong>LCD screen</strong> significantly enhanced the user experience by providing easily accessible, local status information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We improved the detection system by switching from a passive motion sensor to an <strong>Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)</strong>, which allows for more reliable doorstep presence detection. This sensor is fully integrated with the buzzer, LCD, an LED, and the camera, creating a complete and responsive alert system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the project presented some challenges. The <strong>complexity of the breadboard wiring</strong>, due to the high number of connected components, made modifications and debugging difficult. Furthermore, working with the <strong>relay module</strong> was a new experience, requiring extra time to correctly understand its wiring and operational principles. Our only remaining issue is that we were unable to achieve the desired <strong>speed control for the motor</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 text-purple">Final Part Checkpoint</h4>
                <p>
                    Looking back at the whole project, We are really proud of how much we were able to integrate and how cohesive the system feels now. The biggest win was definitely moving from just a pile of components to a working, integrated security system managed through a clean web dashboard. We learned a ton about both hardware interfacing and web service integration.
