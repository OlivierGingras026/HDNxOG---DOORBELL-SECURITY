**Short Reflection**

In this milestone, we reached our main goal, which was to add at least 3 devices and 3 sensors and to put the whole project into a more organized box. We also decided to add an LCD screen, which makes the system easier to understand for humans and just nicer to use.

We improved the detection part too, instead of using a motion sensor, we switched to an ultrasonic sensor, and that was cool because we linked it with the buzzer, the LCD, an LED, and the camera to make a full alert system.

Some things were harder though. The breadboard wiring was a bit annoying because there were a lot of cables and it got tight, so moving things around wasn’t super fun. Also, the relay was new for us, so understanding exactly how to wire it and how it works took some time.

The only negative point we still have right now is that we weren’t able to reduce the motor speed the way we wanted.
